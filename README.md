# ViSE : Visual Semantic Embedding

## Introduction
- Visual-Semantic Embeddings (ViSE) model leverages textual data to learn semantic relationships between labels, and explicitly mapping paired images into a rich semantic embedding space. 
- It is useful for various tasks such as visual question answering, image-text retrieval, image captioning, and scene graph generation.
